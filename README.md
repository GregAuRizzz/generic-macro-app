# GenericMacro

A powerful, visual, no-code macro automation tool for games and daily tasks. 

GenericMacro lets you build complex macro sequences natively, with an integrated macro recorder, visual block timeline editing, advanced humanization features (Anti-Detection), and even Computer Vision (recognizing images on your screen).

## Features
- **Visual Editor**: Drag & drop actions, double-click to edit delays and configurations.
- **Smart Recorder**: Captures your exact keyboard and mouse movements.
- **Computer Vision**: Capable of clicking dynamically based on visual elements (screen searching).
- **Humanization**: Add randomized delays, micro mouse wobbles, and human-like cursor movements to avoid behavioral detection algorithms.
- **Anti-AFK**: Built-in generic Anti-AFK feature with customizable intervals.
- **Share**: Export and Import macros using simple `GMAC-XXXX` share codes.
